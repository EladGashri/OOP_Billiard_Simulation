A Billiard Simulation written in Smalltalk, a pure object-oriented programming language.

The ball objects interact with each other and with objects from other classes by sending messages. methods in response to the messages calculate the balls movement in respond to the player interaction and physical collision between objects.

Each component in the game is represented by a different class, implementing the abstraction principle. Different objects respond differently to the same messages for game events, implementing the polymorphism principle.
